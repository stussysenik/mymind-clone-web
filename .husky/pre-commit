# Git Pre-Commit Hook
# ============================================================================
# This hook runs before each commit to prevent accidental exposure of API keys,
# secrets, and sensitive information.
#
# If the hook exits with a non-zero status, the commit will be aborted.
#
# To enable this hook:
#   chmod +x .husky/pre-commit
#   npx husky add .husky/pre-commit
#
# @fileoverview Pre-commit hook for secret detection
# ============================================================================

set -e

echo "🔒 Running pre-commit checks..."

# Run the secret detection script on staged files
node scripts/check-secrets.js

# The secret detection script will exit with code 1 if secrets are found,
# which will block the commit. If it exits with code 0, the commit proceeds.

echo "✅ Pre-commit checks passed!"
