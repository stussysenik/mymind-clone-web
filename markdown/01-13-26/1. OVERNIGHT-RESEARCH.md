### Best Setup for Overnight Claude Code Workflow

Based on extensive research from developer communities, Anthropic's documentation, and real-world implementations (including GitHub repos, YouTube tutorials, and X discussions), the most reliable and highly reviewed setup for an "overnight" Claude Code workflow is **Claude Code CLI combined with the Ralph Orchestrator**. This enables autonomous, non-stopping prototype building while you sleep, with strong context retention and verification. It's praised for its robustness in long-running tasks, error handling, and ability to handle diverse projects like native iOS apps (in Swift) or Python trading bots.

Why this setup stands out:
- **Autonomous/Overnight Capability**: Uses the "Ralph Wiggum" technique—repeatedly prompting Claude until the task is marked "done" or limits are hit—preventing stalls. Handles rate limits, infinite loops, and verifies work via tests.
- **Context-Saving/Optimized Recall**: Leverages a single `CLAUDE.md` file for persistent project rules, reducing repetition. Supports Multi-Context Prompting (MCP) via servers for database/tool integration, and compresses history for long sessions.
- **Verifiable/Non-Stopping**: Built-in testing loops ensure prototypes work; runs in background with tmux for monitoring.
- **Flexibility for Ideas**: Handles native iOS (Swift/Xcode), Python, or cross-platform. Users report building full apps in hours/days, with 2-3x quality via self-verification.
- **Reviews/Endorsements**: Featured in Anthropic's docs, GitHub "awesome" lists (75+ tests, safety guardrails), and user stories (e.g., 24-hour runs adding 30+ features). Alternatives like agent swarms (Claude-Flow) or Artifacts are good for quick prototypes but less autonomous for overnight.

#### Prerequisites
- Anthropic API key (from claude.ai; use Opus 4.5 model for fewer errors, even if slower).
- macOS/Linux terminal (for iOS, need Xcode installed).
- Git, Python 3, tmux (for background runs).
- Free tier works for starters; Pro for unlimited.

### Step-by-Step Setup Instructions
1. **Install Claude Code CLI**:
   - Run: `pip3 install claude-code` (or from GitHub: `pip3 install git+https://github.com/anthropic/claude-code.git`).
   - Set API key: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here`.
   - Test: `claude code` in a new repo—it opens an interactive session.

2. **Set Up Project Memory (Context-Saving)**:
   - Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your repo root. This is your "AI constitution"—add rules, stack preferences, and constraints. Example content:
     ```
     # Project Rules
     - Always use Swift for iOS prototypes.
     - For Python bots, use libraries like ccxt for trading APIs.
     - Verify all code with unit tests before marking done.
     - Handle errors autonomously; retry up to 3 times.
     - Optimize for recall: Summarize past steps in responses.
     ```
     Commit to Git for team sharing. Update on mistakes to improve recall.

3. **Install Ralph Orchestrator for Overnight/Autonomous Runs**:
   - Clone: `git clone https://github.com/mikeyobrien/ralph-orchestrator.git`.
   - Install deps: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
   - Configure: Edit `config.yaml` with your API key, model (Opus 4.5), and limits (e.g., max iterations=100, rate limit handling).
   - Create a `prompt.md` for your idea: e.g., "Build a Things app clone in Swift with content lock: freeze pages to prevent edits/new items. Include tactile animations."
   - Run: `./ralph.sh prompt.md`—it loops Claude until "I'm done" in output. Use tmux for background: `tmux new -s overnight claude code`.

4. **Enable MCP (Multi-Context Prompting) and Tools**:
   - Install MCP servers: `pip3 install claude-mcp` (connects Claude to DBs/APIs like Polymarket).
   - Add to `CLAUDE.md`: Rules for tool use, e.g., "Use MCP for real-time trading data."
   - Custom slash commands: In `.claude/commands/`, create files like `trade-bot.sh` for repetitive tasks (e.g., "Check mispricings on Kalshi").

5. **Workflow for Building Prototypes**:
   - **Start in Plan Mode**: Always begin with `claude code --plan`. Refine plan (e.g., milestones: UI, logic, lock feature). Switch to auto-accept for execution.
   - **Agent Loop**: Claude gathers context → plans → codes → tests → verifies. For overnight, Ralph handles loops.
   - **Parallel/Sub-Agents**: Run multiple terminals (e.g., one for UI, one for backend). Use sub-agents for deep tasks like codebase search.
   - **Verification**: Always prompt: "Verify with tests." For iOS, integrate Xcode builds; for bots, simulate trades.
   - **Checkpoints**: Add 🛑 in prompts to pause for review (e.g., after milestone 1).

#### Tailored for Your Examples
| Idea | Tech Stack | Setup Tips | Overnight Execution |
|------|------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Things Clone (iOS with Lock)** | Native Swift, Xcode, UIKit/SwiftUI for animations. | Prompt: "Plan a Swift app cloning Things: task lists, pages/projects with freeze lock (read-only mode). Add tactile feedback via UIImpactFeedbackGenerator." Use Claude to generate files, copy to Xcode for build/test. | Ralph loop: Set prompt.md with spec; runs builds/tests overnight. Wake to prototype in Simulator. |
| **Polymarket/Kalshi Trading Bot** | Python, ccxt/pandas for APIs/mispricings, Streamlit for livestream. | Prompt: "Build Python bot detecting mispricings on Polymarket/Kalshi: fetch real-time data, calculate inefficiencies, auto-trade on thresholds." Use MCP for API access. | Ralph loop: Monitors markets overnight; logs trades. Add limits to avoid real funds. |

#### Optimization Tips
- **Run Multiple Instances**: 5+ terminals for parallel work (e.g., one per feature).
- **Error Handling**: Post-tool hooks auto-format/fix code.
- **Cross-Platform**: For non-iOS, add React Native rules in `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Scaling**: For complex ideas, use Claude Projects/Artifacts for UI previews.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Don't mix WHAT/HOW in prompts—focus on spec first. Test in isolated envs (git worktrees).

This setup has powered real apps (e.g., iOS symptom trackers, agent swarms). Start small: Test with a simple prompt, then scale to overnight. If issues, check Anthropic's Agent SDK for custom tweaks.

Here are the **best proven setups** for using Claude (via Anthropic's API with a high-tier "max plan" key for high rate limits) in an agentic, autonomous coding workflow. These draw from popular X (Twitter) posts and open-source tools in late 2025/early 2026, where people run overnight builds with minimal supervision.

The goal is autonomous/overnight dev (AI iterates, codes, tests, fixes via function calling, bash, grep, etc.). Claude Code (official Anthropic CLI tool) dominates as the top choice—it's agentic by design, uses Claude's native tool use (bash, file edits, grep, etc.), and has plugins for looping/autonomy. It's praised for "shipping features overnight" with loops and subagents.

### Why Claude Code Wins for Your Use Case
- **Agentic + Autonomous**: Built-in tool use (bash/grep/tests), hooks (auto-format, pre-commit tests), plugins (e.g., Ralph-Wiggum for infinite loops until task done), subagents (parallel reasoning), and skills (TDD, verification).
- **Overnight Workflows**: People run loops to build entire apps while sleeping (e.g., error fixing, refactoring, verification).
- **Claude API Integration**: Uses your max-plan key for high limits (Opus 4.5 or Sonnet for planning/execution).
- **Testable/Verifiable**: Runs bash/grep, unit tests, Playwright for UI verification.
- **Popular on X**: Hundreds of likes/reposts for workflows like parallel agents, plan → execute, hooks.

Alternatives if Claude Code doesn't fit:
- **Aider** (open-source CLI): Great for repo editing + tests; supports Claude API; simpler but less subagent-heavy. Good for verifiable bash/grep loops.
- **Cline** (VSCode extension, open-source): Agentic in IDE; good for SwiftUI previewing.
- **OpenDevin**: Fully autonomous sandboxed agent; more "hands-off" but heavier setup.

### Should You Use Expo or Native SwiftUI?
Your app sounds like a simple Things 3 clone (task manager) with content lock (e.g., premium-locked notes/tasks).  
- **Native SwiftUI** (recommended for true native feel/performance): Best for polished iOS UX. Agent can generate SwiftUI views, SwiftData/CoreData storage, and lock logic (e.g., UserDefaults/CloudKit flags). But requires Mac + Xcode for builds/tests/simulator.
- **Expo (React Native)**: Easier for agentic iteration (JS code, no Mac needed for dev). Cloud builds via EAS handle iOS. Free tier limits (e.g., build minutes, concurrent jobs) scare many, but for a simple app it's often fine—or upgrade to paid (~$29/mo). Many X users prefer it for AI-generated mobile apps to avoid Xcode headaches.

**Verdict**: Start with **native SwiftUI** if you have a Mac (best match for "native iOS"). If agent struggles or you want faster iteration, switch to Expo. AI agents handle both well, but SwiftUI needs Mac.

### Best Tech Stack
- **Frontend/UI**: SwiftUI (declarative, agent-friendly).
- **Storage**: SwiftData (modern) or CoreData.
- **Content Lock**: Simple flag (e.g., `@AppStorage` or purchase verification).
- **Agent Tool**: Claude Code (primary) + bash/grep for verification.
- **Hardware**: Mac (required for iOS simulator/builds).

### Proven Setup Instructions (Claude Code – Most Popular on X)
1. **Get API Key**  
   Use your max-plan Anthropic key (high limits for overnight runs).

2. **Install Claude Code**  
   ```bash
   # Via pip (common method from X posts)
   pip install claude-code
   # Or check Anthropic docs/GitHub for latest
   ```
   Set key:  
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```

3. **Create Project Repo**  
   ```bash
   mkdir my-things-clone && cd my-things-clone
   git init
   claude # Start Claude Code
   ```

4. **Basic Autonomous Workflow (Popular X Setup)**  
   - Run in plan mode first: `/plan Build a SwiftUI iOS task manager clone of Things 3 with content lock (locked tasks/notes require unlock). Use SwiftData. Make it testable with unit tests.`
   - Iterate until plan is solid.
   - Switch to execute: `/auto-accept` or manual approval.
   - Add skills/hooks (from .claude/commands/ or plugins):
     - TDD skill (writes/runs tests).
     - Bash verification (e.g., `xcodebuild test`).
   - For overnight autonomy:
     - Install Ralph-Wiggum plugin (from X: `claude --plugin-dir ./plugins`).
     - Run loop: `/ralph-wiggum:ralph-loop` — agent picks tasks, implements, tests, commits until done.
     - Use parallel tabs (e.g., 3 terminals: one for UI, one for logic, one for verification).

5. **Advanced Tips from X (High-Engagement Posts)**  
   - **Parallel Agents**: Run 3-5 tabs (e.g., Opus 4.5 for planning, Sonnet for execution). Use subagents (code reviewer, tester).  
   - **Hooks**: Auto-format on save, pre-commit tests (e.g., bash `swift test`).  
   - **Verification**: Add Playwright/MCP for UI checks; grep logs for errors.  
   - **Skills/Subagents**: Create custom ones (e.g., "content-lock architect").  
   - **Overnight Mode**: Prompt: "Loop until app builds and tests pass on simulator. Fix bugs autonomously."  
   - **iOS-Specific**: Prompt agent to create Xcode project (`swift package init --type executable`), run `xcodebuild`, open simulator (`open -a Simulator`).  
   - **Permissions**: `/permissions` to allow bash commands safely.

6. **If Switching to Expo**  
   - `npx create-expo-app my-app`  
   - Run Claude Code in the repo.  
   - Prompt: "Build React Native task app with Expo + content lock."  
   - Test: `expo start` (iOS simulator via cloud/local).  
   - Builds: `eas build --platform ios` (free tier ok for testing).

### Quick Start Prompt for Your App
In Claude Code:  
"Create a native SwiftUI iOS app: task manager like Things 3. Features: tasks/projects, checklists, content lock (locked tasks visible but uneditable without unlock). Use SwiftData. Generate full project structure, tests. Run xcodebuild and verify. Loop fixes overnight."

This should get you a testable prototype. Start small (plan phase), then go autonomous. If stuck, X has tons of CLAUDE.md templates for repos.
